This directory contains a few short example programs which make use of libgl13. Run 'make' to build each of them.
Root privilege is required to interface with the G13 device, unless udev has been configured otherwise (see the top-level README for advice on how to do this)
When running the 'image' example, 'cd' to the 'image' directory first.
