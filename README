libg13

Utility library for interfacing with Logitech G13 devices

Requirements:
* libusb: https://libusb.info/

To allow interfacing with the G13 device without root privilege, create the file /etc/udev/rules.d/50-g13.rules and add the following line:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="046d", ATTRS{idProduct}=="c21c", TAG+="uaccess"

Note that after saving this file, the device needs to be unplugged and plugged back in before the changes will take effect.

Due credit goes to ecraven for the g13 driver available at https://github.com/ecraven/g13, which was an invaluable reference in establishing the core functionality.
